# fraction-calculator
Calculator built using Java. GUI built using Java Swing.
Operates on fractions, decimals and integers. Handles percentages when "%" button is clicked, by converting them to the equivalent decimal value to be multiplied against. Includes a "convert" button which is used to convert decimal values to fractions and fractions to decimals. To keep things simple, especially with displaying fraction values, the calculator only works with proper and improper fractions——no mixed numbers. 

Operations can be continuous, meaning that once a solution is displayed, the user can then operate on the solution by selecting an operator, or the user can replace the solution with the next operand without needing to select "AC".

Calculator buttons must be clicked on. While the text fields appear editable, the application is not set up to handle typed user input, though it could be implemented with a few changes.
