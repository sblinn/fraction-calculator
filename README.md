# fraction-calculator
Java calculator which operates on fractions, decimals and integers. GUI built using Java Swing. Not yet able to directly input negative values. However, it is possible to operate on negative values that are the resulting solution to prior equation, i.e. (2 - 3 = -1; then performing operation on -1).
